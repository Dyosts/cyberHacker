            <h3>Brute Force SSH</h3>
            <p>
                A brute force SSH attack is when a hacker repeatedly tries different username and password combinations
                to access a server via SSH. It's like trying every possible key to unlock a door. This attack exploits
                weak
                or default credentials, and securing servers with strong passwords or SSH keys helps protect against
                it.

            <h3>Command Injection</h3>
            <p>
                Command injection is a cyberattack where a hacker tricks an application into executing system-level
                commands
                by exploiting poorly secured input fields. This allows the attacker to take control of the system, steal
                data, or cause damage. Validating and sanitizing user inputs helps prevent such attacks.

            <h3>Privileged User Session</h3>
            <p>
                Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a privileged user account, like an
                admin or root account. This gives them full control over a system, allowing them to modify settings,
                steal
                data, or deploy malware. Strong access controls and regular privilege audits can help mitigate this
                risk.
