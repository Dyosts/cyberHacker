            <h3>Brute Force SSH</h3>
            <p>
                A brute force SSH attack is when a hacker repeatedly tries different username and password combinations
                to access a server via SSH. It's like trying every possible key to unlock a door. This attack exploits
                weak
                or default credentials, and securing servers with strong passwords or SSH keys helps protect against
                it.

            <h3>Phishing Mail</h3>
            <p>
                A phishing email is a fake message designed to trick you into revealing personal information, like
                passwords
                or credit card details. It often pretends to be from a trusted organization, like a bank or a well-known
                company, and may include urgent language or fake links to steal your data.

            <h3>USB Drive Infection</h3>
            <p>
                A USB drop attack happens when a malicious USB drive is left in a public place, hoping someone will plug
                it
                into their computer. Once connected, the USB can install malware or steal data automatically. It's a
                reminder never to trust unknown USB drives.

            <h3>Command Injection</h3>
            <p>
                Command injection is a cyberattack where a hacker tricks an application into executing system-level
                commands
                by exploiting poorly secured input fields. This allows the attacker to take control of the system, steal
                data, or cause damage. Validating and sanitizing user inputs helps prevent such attacks.
            </p>
        </article>

            <h3>Privileged User Session</h3>
            <p>
                Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a privileged user account, like an
                admin or root account. This gives them full control over a system, allowing them to modify settings,
                steal
                data, or deploy malware. Strong access controls and regular privilege audits can help mitigate this
                risk.

            <h3>Physic Infrastructure Sabotage</h3>
            <p>
                Physical infrastructure sabotage involves intentionally damaging or disrupting critical systems, like
                servers, power grids, or data centers. This can result in service outages, data loss, or even safety
                hazards. Securing physical access to infrastructure and monitoring for suspicious activity are key
                defenses.

            <h3>DDoS Attack</h3>
            <p>
                A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is when multiple compromised computers or devices are used
                to flood a server, network, or website with excessive traffic, overwhelming it and causing it to become
                slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable. The goal is to disrupt services, often for malicious
                purposes or to extort the targeted organization.

            <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
            <p>
                SQL injection is a type of cyberattack where an attacker inserts or manipulates malicious SQL queries
                into input fields (like login forms) to access or manipulate a database. This can lead to unauthorized
                data access, data loss, or even complete control over the database. Proper input validation and using
                parameterized queries are key defenses against SQL injection.

            <h3>Employee Awareness Training</h3>
            <p>
                Employee awareness training is the process of educating staff about security risks and best practices to
                prevent cyberattacks. This includes teaching them how to recognize phishing emails, create strong
                passwords,
                and follow company security policies. It helps reduce human error, which is often the weakest link in
                cybersecurity.

            <h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns or behaviors in network traffic, system
                logs, or user activities that may indicate a potential security threat. It uses advanced algorithms and
                machine learning to spot deviations from normal behavior, helping to detect cyberattacks or breaches
                early.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Session Monitoring System</h3>
            <p>
                A session monitoring system tracks and records user activities during their interaction with a system or
                application. It helps detect suspicious behavior, unauthorized access, or potential security breaches by
                providing real-time visibility into user actions, such as login times, accessed data, and commands
                executed.
                This can improve security and ensure compliance.

            <h3>Mass Phishing Wave</h3>
            <p>
                A mass phishing wave refers to a large-scale phishing attack where cybercriminals send fraudulent emails
                to thousands or even millions of recipients in an attempt to steal sensitive information like login
                credentials or financial details. These attacks are often disguised as urgent or legitimate requests
                from trusted sources, making them difficult to spot.

            <h3>Secure Proxy Network</h3>
            <p>
                A secure proxy network acts as an intermediary between users and the internet, hiding their IP addresses
                and encrypting data traffic. It helps protect privacy, bypass restrictions, and shield systems from
                direct exposure to cyber threats. Advanced secure proxies also monitor traffic to detect and block
                malicious activity.

        <article>
            <h3>Data Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                Data encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format that can only be read or decrypted
                by authorized parties with the correct decryption key. It protects sensitive information, such as
                passwords or financial data, from being accessed by unauthorized individuals, ensuring privacy and
                security both during transmission and storage.

            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
            <p>
                Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files or locks them out of their
                system, demanding a ransom payment (often in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key or to
                restore access. It can spread through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in the
                system. The best defense is regular backups and security awareness.

            <h3>Backdoor</h3>
            <p>
                A backdoor is a secret method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a system, allowing
                unauthorized access to the system or network. It is often used by hackers to maintain access to a
                compromised system even after the original security vulnerabilities are patched. Backdoors can be
                installed via malware or by exploiting system weaknesses.
